# Ansible
This is my Ansible Repository !!

Ansible Notes:

- Install Openssh on all the machines.
- Install ansible on the control machine.
- Create inventory file on the control machine. { This file consists of the hosts to be managed by ansible.}
    - This file can also store separate credentials for different hosts. 
- Create ansible.cfg file on the control machine. { This file contains the username and location of the private keys used to connect to the hosts to be managed.}
    - This file can hold a default credentials for all machines.
